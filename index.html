                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from the University of California, Davis with a degree in History
                        and International Relations, I landed a job with the City of San Diego working in 
                        the City Clerk's Office. After a little over a year working there, I relocated to the Bay Area and continued to pursue
                        my passion for civil service by joining the Human Services Agency of the County of San Mateo
                        as a social worker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work as a social worker is what's driving me to pursue software engineering. I hope to ultilze
                        the skills I learn to provide communities better access and knowledge of the public assistance programs
                        available to them.
